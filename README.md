# Boston-House-Price-Prediction

### Problem Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.


### Data Description
Two types of dataset are provided: training set and test set. In fact, training data is the initial dataset you use to teach a machine learning application to recognize patterns or perform to your criteria, while testing data is used to evaluate your modelâ€™s accuracy and to make prediction as well. See Data for full description.


### Goal
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project aims to predict the final price of each home. That's, for each Id in the test set, you want to predict the value of the SalePrice variable
